        <h1>Yeah, We Get It. We Can Never Learn Math.</h1>
        <h3>People like to say math is hard. Math is just not for everyone. Some people just can’t learn it. Those
            people are dumb.</h3>
        <p>Among the people who math is not for are the artists. Let me start by clarifying that this is not actually
            true. It is in fact abundantly false because artists are equally equipped to learn math, if not more. Math
            is an incredibly visual language. Teachers who are not visual thinkers themselves tend to ignore this.
            Whether they do not consider teaching visually or assume it is too complex for their students, visual
            learners are so rarely catered to in most teachers' curriculums. As an artist myself, this breaks my heart.
            I have worked as a mathematics tutor for students of kindergarten math to Calculus II, and seeing how many
            visual learners have been turned away from math altogether is simply unacceptable. I will describe using
            both my experiences as well as the writings of _____ to show how an artist can learn math, how it can be
            taught, and how it can be extrapolated if not presented in an inherantly visual representation.</p>

            <h2>How an Artist Learns Math: Breaking It Down and Learning to Chill</h2>
            <p>The most useful advice I’ve given as a math tutor is to break it down. Come back with me to the Spring of
                2016. I was barely seventeen years old in my second semester of college at a very rigorous Liberal Arts
                School. My dad was getting a divorce with his third wife, and it was messy. I had a cruel boyfriend who
                I was too naive to let go of, and I was spiralling out of control. Meanwhile, I was taking a Calculus
                heavy Physics II course (without a strong understanding of Calculus) at a school where nothing was easy,
                and everything was made to make you think. I couldn’t think, and I felt like a failure, and when I
                looked at those pages of equations, that is what they were. They were pages of equations, and I felt
                like maybe I’m not cut out to learn such a high level of math. You might be like, “Well, duh, Abby..
                Pages of equations, that’s what math is!” but you would be wrong! The secret to learning math is seeing
                it as an algorithm. This is a threatening word that really just means a process. To show you what I
                mean, here is a generic example:</p>
            <article class="example">
                <div class="example-head">
                    <h3>Example 1: Kittens and Apples</h3>
                    <h4>So, this cute kitten has 3 apples. It’s owner gives it 2 more (because why not, right?). Now,
                        some
                        villainous character steals 4 apples from the kitten (what a douche!). The kitten cries for long
                        enough that it’s owner gives it 5 more.</h4>
                </div>

                    <article class="step">
                        <h3>Step 1: Cat With Apples</h3>
                        <p class="figure-txt">Look at this question like a still life. At a glance, you’re like
                            “oof, that’s a lot,” but if you look at each instance, object, or task, it becomes
                            way easier. So, let’s start with our background.</p>
                        <img class="figure" src="1-1.png" alt="kitten starts with 3 apples">

                        <p class="figure-txt">Now, our kitten's selfless owner has gifted our subject 2 more
                            apples, and now our cat looks like the following.</p>

                    </article>
                    <article class="step">
                        <h3>Step 3: Cat's Apples Get Stolen</h3>
                        <p class="figure-txt">The next thing that happens to our kitten is it's apples get stolen by
                            some thief. Totally a dick move. Like stealing candy from a baby. Anyways, now our cat looks
                            like this: 4 apples lighter</p>

                        <h3>Step 4: Cat's Resolve</h3>
                        <p class="figure-txt">Now our generous owner comes through again with FIVE more apples for the kitten. The kitten is happy.</p>

            <p>Congrats! That was an algorithm! Notice how the main aspect of it was just breaking it down, dealing with each event as it comes up in the problem. It is important to 'enjoy' or at least take your time to understand the reason behind each step. It's when you lose sight of each individual point of reason that the whole math shebang becomes unreasonable.</p>
            <p>Now, you can start thinking about things that are a little more complex than addition and subtraction. We can start with multiplication!</p>

                    <h3>Example 2: Gina Sells Seashells</h3>
                    <h4>Gina has 5 different shells that she collected today at the beach. Some people in town have offered to give her $1.50 for each shell she sells to them. If she sells one of the townies 3 of them, and sells the other one the rest, how much does she make off each person? How much has she made in total?</h4>
